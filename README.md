# field-trip

In this repository I explore many things around implementing semantics, including
* the gist of ParentheC
* Garbage Collection
* programming in C with algebraic data type

What I have done so far includes
* a C program that interpreter a C data structure that correspond to a very small unityped lambda calculus
* a Racket program that generate most part of the C program (including code for GC)
* a Racket program that compile a bigger language to the small language
